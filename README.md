# Chatbot
- A **chatbot** is an artificial intelligence-powered piece of software in a device (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant etc), application, website or other networks that try to gauge consumerâ€™s needs and then assist them to perform a particular task like a commercial transaction, hotel booking, form submission etc . #definition
- How do Chatbots work?
    - **Rule-Based**
        - a bot answers questions based on some rules on which it is trained on the rules defined can be very simple to very complex. The bots can handle simple queries but fail to manage complex ones.
    - **Self-learning**
        - Self-learning bots are the ones that use some Machine Learning-based approaches and are definitely more efficient than rule-based bots. These ways, from rule-based if-else conditional logic to machine learning classifiers the chatbot uses the message and context of the conversation for selecting the best response from a predefined list of bot messages.
            - bots can be of further two types:
                - **Retrieval Based**
                    - a chatbot uses some heuristic to select a response from a library of predefined responses.
                    - Heuristics for selecting a response can be engineered in many different 
                - **Generative**
                    - ****bots can generate the answers and not always replies with one of the answers from a set of answers
                    - This makes them more intelligent as they take word by word from the query and generates the answers.
